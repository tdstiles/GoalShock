# Inspector's Journal - Strategy Log

## 2026-01-18 - Initial Audit
**Trend:** N/A (Baseline)
**Hotspot:** Entire Backend (0% real coverage) & Entire Frontend (0 tests).
**Recommendation:** Focus Shield on setting up the test harness for both Frontend and Backend. Medic is not needed yet as there are no failing tests (just no tests at all).
