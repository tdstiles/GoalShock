## 2024-05-22 - Market Probability Bars
**Clutter:** Markets displayed YES/NO prices as raw text ($0.75 / $0.25), requiring users to mentally visualize the spread.
**Clarity:** Added a horizontal Probability Bar (Green/Red split) to instantly show market sentiment.
**Principle:** "Show, Don't Just Tell" - Visual weight (bar width) is faster to process than numerical comparison.
