# GoalShock - Complete Setup & Run Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected output:**
```
Successfully installed fastapi-0.104.1 uvicorn-0.24.0 httpx-0.25.1 ...
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your API keys
nano .env  # or use any text editor
```

**Minimum required:**
```bash
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your-rapidapi-key-here
```

**For live trading, also add:**
```bash
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=your-polymarket-wallet
POLYMARKET_WALLET_KEY=your-private-key
KALSHI_API_KEY=your-kalshi-email
KALSHI_API_SECRET=your-kalshi-password
```

### Step 3: Run Unified Engine

python engine_unified.py --mode simulation
```

**You should see:**
```

## 🧪 Testing Without Live API Keys

If you don't have API keys yet, you can still test the engine structure:

```bash
# Set dummy values in .env
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=test-key
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=test-wallet
KALSHI_API_KEY=test@email.com
KALSHI_API_SECRET=test-password

# Run engine
python engine_unified.py --mode simulation
```

Engine will start but won't fetch real data (expected behavior without valid keys).

## 🎯 What Happens When Engine Runs

### 1. Goal Detection Loop (Every 10 seconds)
```
Fetch live fixtures from API-Football
    ↓
Compare current scores with previous
    ↓
Detect new goals
    ↓
Process each goal event
```

### 2. Trade Decision
```
Goal scored by underdog?
    ├─ NO → Skip
    └─ YES → Check if underdog is LEADING
        ├─ Tied (1-1) → Skip ❌
        ├─ Losing (1-2) → Skip ❌
        └─ LEADING (2-1) → Execute Trade ✅
```

### 3. Position Monitoring (Every 10 seconds)
```
For each open position:
    Fetch current market price
    Calculate P&L percentage
    ├─ P&L >= +15% → Close (Take-Profit)
    └─ P&L <= -10% → Close (Stop-Loss)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named 'data'"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in backend directory
cd backend

# Run from backend directory
python engine_unified.py --mode simulation
```

### Issue: "API-Football error: 401"
**Solution:**
- Check your `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` is correct
- Verify key is active on RapidAPI dashboard
- Check you haven't exceeded daily quota (100 requests/day free)

### Issue: "No live fixtures currently"
**Solution:**
- This is normal when no soccer matches are live
- Check https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/fixtures?live=all manually
- Engine will find fixtures when games are live

### Issue: Engine starts but no trades execute
**Possible reasons:**
1. No live matches currently ✅ (Normal)
2. No goals being scored ✅ (Normal)
3. Goals by favorite, not underdog ✅ (Normal)
4. Underdog scored but tied/losing ✅ (Normal - working as designed)

**This is expected behavior!** Engine only trades when:
- ✅ Underdog scores
- ✅ AND underdog is now LEADING (not tied)
